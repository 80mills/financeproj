# Financial Management System Architecture

## Overview
A comprehensive financial management system designed to manage LLC and personal finances while maintaining corporate veil separation. The system features multi-bank integration, visual workflow builder, and automated financial operations.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Account Integration
- **Bank Accounts**: Checking, savings, money market
- **Credit Cards**: Multiple providers
- **Loans**: Business loans, personal loans, mortgages
- **Bills**: Utilities, subscriptions, recurring payments
- **Investment Accounts**: Brokerage, retirement

### 2. Corporate Veil Preservation
- Strict separation between LLC and personal entities
- Automatic documentation of inter-entity transfers
- Equity contribution tracking
- Owner draw/distribution tracking
- Loan tracking between entities

### 3. Visual Workflow Builder
- Drag-and-drop interface similar to n8n
- Pre-built workflow templates
- Custom workflow creation
- Conditional logic support
- Scheduled execution

### 4. Every Dollar Accounting
- Zero-based budgeting approach
- Money flow visualization
- Allocation tracking
- Envelope budgeting support

### 5. Automation Features
- Automated savings transfers
- Bill pay automation
- Investment automation
- Alert and notification system

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Workflow Builder**: React Flow or custom implementation
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js

### Bank Integration
- **Primary Service**: Plaid (best for personal use)
- **Fallback**: Manual CSV import
- **Security**: OAuth2 authentication
- **Data Sync**: Webhook-based real-time updates

### Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for sensitive data at rest
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, CSP headers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history
- **MFA**: TOTP-based two-factor authentication

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **users**: User authentication and profile
2. **entities**: LLC and personal entities
3. **accounts**: Bank accounts, credit cards, loans
4. **transactions**: All financial transactions
5. **workflows**: Saved workflow configurations
6. **workflow_executions**: Workflow run history
7. **budgets**: Budget configurations
8. **allocations**: Money allocations
9. **bills**: Recurring bills and payments
10. **audit_log**: Complete audit trail

### Key Relationships
- Users own multiple entities
- Entities have multiple accounts
- Transactions link to accounts and entities
- Workflows can span multiple entities (with proper documentation)
- Inter-entity transfers create paired transactions

## Workflow Engine Design

### Components
1. **Node Types**:
   - Source (account, income)
   - Destination (account, expense category)
   - Condition (if/then logic)
   - Action (transfer, pay bill, invest)
   - Schedule (timing triggers)

2. **Execution Engine**:
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Supports manual and automated triggers
   - Transaction validation
   - Rollback capability

3. **Visual Builder**:
   - Drag-and-drop nodes
   - Connection validation
   - Real-time preview
   - Template library

## Bank Connection Strategy

### For Personal Use
1. **Plaid Personal Access**:
   - Development environment (100 free accounts)
   - Production access for personal use
   - Supports 11,000+ financial institutions

2. **Manual Import Fallback**:
   - CSV/OFX file import
   - Bank statement PDF parsing
   - Manual transaction entry

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Never store bank credentials
   - Use OAuth when available
   - Implement webhook signature verification
   - Regular security audits
